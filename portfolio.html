    <h1 style="color:#98AFC7; text-align:center; ">this is a game where you are asked to pick one of the many racers to bet on. once you do you are greated with a text asking how much you want to bet on that racer. my partner and i used a randomizer code to set a random speed for each turtle, so that the race is random and fair. after the match the scorebord will show the average speed of the turtles, and will announce whether you won or lost. along with that it will also state how much money you either made or lost. &#128034</h1>
